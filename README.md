# LWFC
I want to make a light "library" i guess for using wave function collapse algorithm easily and mess around with in the future.


There is an example of how it can be use in Program.cs.

TODO : 

-Allow to use Mirroring/Rotating etc.

-Optimize the algorithm to find pattern.

-Remove the confusion between PatternSize and OutputSize

DONE : 

-Allow to use rectangular sample.

-Allow to compute rectangular output.

-Upgrading how entropy are calculated. (actually it's just simplified but it's faster and give the same result sooo..)

-Allow to save PatternMap data to not recalculate each time (it took even more time than generating content some time).
